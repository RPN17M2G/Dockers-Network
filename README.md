# Dockers-Network

A functional Docker-based network setup where each container is assigned a **static IP address**. The network is defined using **Dockerfiles** and **Docker Compose**, with supporting **Python scripts** for testing and network mapping.

## Features

- Static IP assignment for each Docker container
- Modular configuration using `docker-compose.yml` and individual `Dockerfile`s
- Python scripts for:
  - Verifying connectivity
  - Mapping the network structure

## Use Cases

- Development environments requiring predictable networking
- Simulation of network topologies
- Containerized integration testing
